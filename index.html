            <p>
                iPhone owners across the nation are rushing to download a groundbreaking new app that promises to

            <p>
                Ads bombard you while watching videos, reading news, or shopping online. They disrupt browsing, slow
                your
                device, and consume up to 80% of your data.
            </p>

            <p>Ever noticed how after viewing a product on Amazon or eBay, you're haunted by ads for that same item on
                every
                website you visit for months? That's because advertisers are tracking your online activity.</p>
